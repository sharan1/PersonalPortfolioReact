New challenges have always fascinated me, especially when it comes to cutting-edge technologies. Presently, I find myself at the intersection between __creativity__ and __logic__, solving problems with a fresh and multi-disciplinary approach.

## Skills

I started programming at the beginning of my undergraduate years and have never looked back since. I have done programming in a multitude of programming/scripting languages like __C__, __C++__, __Java__, __Python__, __Scala__, __PHP__, __Javascript__ (including __D3.js__, __React.js__, __JQuery__), __AJAX__, __CSS__ and __HTML__.

I have some exposure using big data technologies like Spark, Hadoop, Kafka, Redis etc and also have some knowledge of developer applications, frameworks, agile methodologies and best practices (including OOD and software architecture(client/server, service oriented)). I am also experienced with BigData systems, GIT/SVN, MVC, OOPs/Design Patterns, REST APIs and relational/non-relational databases.

I have also worked on real time applications using __Spark Streaming__ (scala). __MongoDB__, __Redis__, __Spark SQL__ and __MySQL__ are some of the database/querying languages, I have worked on.

I am __passionate__ about __programming__ and thus, other than being a full stack developer, I regularly take part in coding competitions on websites like __LeetCode__, __HackerRank__, __Codechef__ etc.

In my free time, I enjoy sports, movies and reading fictional novels.

My belief is that a programming language is just a tool in oneâ€™s toolbox. You just have to pick the right tool for the job.

Always experimenting, always learning, never bored.
